def kth_perfect_number(k: int) -> int:
    """
    A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive
    divisors, excluding the number itself. For example, 6 has divisors 1, 2, 3 and 6, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number. The first 4 perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496 and 8128.

    Write a program in C, C++, Python or Java that inputs a positive integer k, and then prints the kth perfect number. For example, if the input of the program is 4, then the program
    should print the line

    The 4th perfect number is 8128.

    However, if there is a perfect number that is odd and is no greater than the kth perfectnumber, your program should print instead the line

    <u>We have found an odd perferct number.</u>

    return k
